            We are purposefully nonpartisan because we know that voters and their networks are complex. Voting decisions are rarely single issue, and we make better decisions when lots of information is present.

          <AboutDescriptionContainer>
            After meeting in Oakland in the spring of 2012, We Vote co-founders Dale McGrew and Jenifer Fernandez Ancona became fast friends.
            {' '}
            Dale brings Silicon Valley experience from founding and successfully selling two high tech startups,
            {' '}
            and Jenifer brings political, advocacy and fundraising experience from years on the front-lines of national campaigns.
            {' '}
            Through frequent conversations, the idea of a nonprofit “Yelp for Politics” was born.
            {' '}
            Founded in 2014, We Vote would be a community for voters, they decided, created by people concerned about where this country is heading.
            {' '}
            Being an open source, volunteer-driven project means anyone can contribute. Kind of like democracy.
